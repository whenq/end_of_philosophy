# end_of_philosophy
these text are for the canonical understanding of the world itself
the texts are not all polished yet, only 'state' and 'understood' are somewhat polished
all the texts are for understanding, so either one have understood it or not

the reading order are as follows:
being: the bare sense of Being, that philosophy have been stuck with since the very start, this is the ultimate veil
authority: shows that final understanding should be obvious once is understood
state: critique of worldy cope
understood: the canonical understanding itself

the 'understanding' text is an old one
the 'problems' series are also old but they are advance and can only be read after the main texts
