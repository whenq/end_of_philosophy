when one see a being (x), in any sense, its most bare sense is 'being x', for all beings
for 'being x' literally is 'Being-in-x-way'
this being literally IS Being itself in this way, literally is 'Being-in-this-way'
it not that there is some being and then it can be Being-in-this-way, but Being-in-this-way is it
'being this' is just another way to write 'Being-in-this-way'
and since each being is nothing more but Being-in-this-way, there is only Being. but this is not to say that there is no 'this being' at all, for it 'is' or 'being' in so far as 'being this' is it, in so far as 'Being-in-this-way' is
the whole ontology is what it means with 'Being'
the whole ontology is what it means with 'Being being itself', 'being Being', which just mean 'Being'
for Being does not sit still or then 'being Being'
it is not that Being is 'doing' anything, it not that beings are not Being, or there is Being without beings - without Being-in-these-way. beings are Being-in-these-way, so there is only Being being itself, and all those phrase is what to be understood with 'Being'

being in itself, Being-in-this-way (directly or indirectly), being [x]
being in beings, Being-in-these-ways (directly or indirectly) [various beings]
being in Being, Being-in-this-way (directly) [nous in Being, and Being from this perspective is called Good]
Being itself [One]

being [x] indirectly, is to say this being [x] is beings-in-these-way in which for each of these beings may be directly or indirectly Being-in-this-way (if indirectly it is beings-in-these-way)
