being x
the bare sense of being is the sense of the term being as used in the phrase 'being x', the most obvious sense
any sense of being whatsoever must already being this sense
and understanding simply understands, that being in this sense is, in some sense, like the sense of 'what it's like'
bare sense of being, as in grasping it directly but barely understand it, but understand that it is curently not fully understood
to say of anything at all, for the meaning of expressions, are already being in that sense
for meaning already is, being meaning


for 'A' is 'Being itself'
and B is-A-in-this-qualified-sense
but that would just mean 'being A in this qualified sense' is 'being B' or 'B'
B is in so far as it is A in this sense, and B is but is nothing but A in some sense, but this is not to say 'there is no B at all'
it is not that there is some A and then it derive B as its mode
but the whole ontology is what 'being A'/'A' mean (and since A is Being itself)
so the whole ontology is what 'being Being' mean, but that just mean 'Being'
the whole ontology is what 'Being' mean, this is what it meant with 'one'
the one would not mean the same if the whole ontology is not what 'the one' mean, as if Being can chose to sit still or then 'being Being'

we start with the bare understanding of being and seek to understand it
being is literally the is
so B is anything is just Being in some sense
and the phrase 'Being in some sense' is not to use the full meaning of Being and say it do something, but that phrase is a partial understanding
and only make sense when everything have been said, the whole ontology is literally what 'Being' is to be understood

we simply have not know what A is when we say B is A in some sense
and at finality we know that all that we have said is to be understood as 'A'
and in this understanding B remain fully B but is just A in some sense, B is A in some sense, nothing but A, but to say A is-nothing-but B would make nonsense, A is still B in some sense
since the whole ontology is just A, and this ontology is such that its understanding include B is A in some sense, 'being-A-in-this-very-sense' (which just is 'being-in-this-very-sense) is 'being-B'

B is-A-in-some-sense, which just mean 'being-in-this-sense', and this is a partial finding about Being
the whole ontology is literallly 'Being' while everything we say like
B is-A-in-some-sense is fully true in that sense, because it talks about Being, 'being-in-this-sense' as B

Being is to be understood with B as 'being-in-this-sense', without it Being is no longer Being (it not about epistemic)

we do not say the Being 'doing' anything, but in the understanding of Being, we understand also that B is real and is to be understood as 'Being-in-this-sense' which is nothing but Being, but Being is not reduced to all of that
understand the whole ontology as
Being being itself
being Being
which just mean 'Being'

this is what it meant with neoplatonism (even though they say the one is beyond being, it is because what they mean with being is the old sense, the one is their new understanding of Being itself)
B is just some random being, like nous
the A and B is a abstract schema for the core idea



when one see a being (x), in any sense, its most bare sense is 'being x', for all beings
for 'being x' literally is 'Being-in-x-way'
this being literally IS Being itself in this way, literally is 'Being-in-this-way'
it not that there is some being and then it can be Being-in-this-way, but Being-in-this-way is it
'being this' is just another way to write 'Being-in-this-way'
and since each being is nothing more but Being-in-this-way, there is only Being. but this is not to say that there is no 'this being' at all, for it 'is' or 'being' in so far as 'being this' is it, in so far as 'Being-in-this-way' is
the whole ontology is what it means with 'Being'
the whole ontology is what it means with 'Being being itself', 'being Being', which just mean 'Being'
for Being does not sit still or then 'being Being'
it is not that Being is 'doing' anything, it not that beings are not Being, or there is Being without beings - without Being-in-these-way. beings are Being-in-these-way, so there is only Being being itself, and all those phrase is what to be understood with 'Being'
