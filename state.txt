back then, the world was 'the world as it currently was', that is to say, the world was newest and that was all there was, denying this is exactly like saying 'the world back then was not the world back then at all' which is utter nonsense, let call this world.1
now, the world is 'the world currently', which is the world as newest, let call the this world.2
but when the world is 1, we ask 'where' is world.2?
if it in world.1 at all in any sense (as some may incist), we can at least say 'world.2 in world.1'
so now, when the world is 2, we ask 'where' is world.1?
for some may incist it is now its turn to be in world.2, we can at least say 'world.1 in world.2'
but again, when the world is 1, where is 'world.1 in world.2'?
it is in 'world.2 in world.1'?
one could say yes, and we can keep repeat this or say 'it is nowhere at all back then'
one can even incist that the regress exhaust by fiat, but again what we have after that is still 'the world currently', for it seems that one's world have ended here
that is to say the world is strictly static (as one has incisted) (which is obvious nonsense)
or the current world is literal magic that is its own 'when' (that is only 'when it is' does it 'firstly is' at all), which does not come from any hidden principle at all (obvious, since this would already have been counted in 'the world'), nor that this should then cease at all (we would just ask 'where' the act of cease all over again)
