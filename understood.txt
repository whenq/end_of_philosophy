for naive beings, appearances are just 'magically so'
for science, 'why do the rules do the world at all?' is answered with 'they just do, magically so'
for any so claimed 'understanding', 'why does this does the world at all?' is answered with 'it just does, magically so'

for that 'magically so' borrows the canonical authority its authoritative power, it is the mark of presumptuous beings, for those beings have not understood the world at all, but merely ever deem 'their ways of seeing the world' authoritative

for any transitive understanding, it understands beings as 'magically so'
that understanding indeed literally 'is' each and every of those being-in-a-way, that understanding literally is beings-in-those-way, understanding as being in beings, that why for it those beings are 'magically so', for it has mistaken being in beings, with being in the world
so when understanding in the world, it in the world directly, it is directly the-world-in-this-way, or Being-in-this-way (for if 'Being' is the same name 'the world'), while still in beings (for this is why it still is 'here')
while it does not in the world, it understand beings as magically so since it now directly in those beings, it could be that some of those beings are directly in the world, that is, in some sense understanding still is the-world-in-this-way (in the world) but not as directly

when a naive being see some beings and deems them as 'magically so', they are in fact indirectly 'in the world' and directly 'in those beings', that why there is nothing more to it for them
a naive being as such, as in the world in such a way deems being-it (being-in-its-way) is obvious, deems beings that it in are obvious
so when a being get close to other beings, it is indeed more 'in' them, it understand them more, it literally is more them-in-a-way

so it is named transitive understanding for being in beings, and intransitive understanding (or having understood) for being in the world

it is then asked
'has understanding ever understood at all?'

the world itself is the authority for 'its canonical understanding' and hence 'having understood' is obvious in itself
when a being is in the world directly, it have understood, and this is obvious to it

for the world is the authority for its canonical understanding, should it then even has some other understanding that refutes the canon? obviously not
the canonical understanding of the world is just 'what the world inherently is' 'the sense for the world itself' 'when being in the world itself', and hence the world only has one canonical understanding, other small understandings that are authorized by that are those that are already inherent within the canonical understanding, they are merely just explicitations of it

for senses are just understandings, and are just meanings
for empiricals, senses are just being in these beings
and understanding, senses are also just being in these (abstract) beings
being in itself
being in beings
being in the world (Being)
the world (Being) itself

a meaning must meant to mean exactly a meaning, and that is about it
and so if it does not, it is without meaning (nonsense)
meanings are not expressions, and expressions have never ensured understanding at all, yet expressions of meanings have been successfully understood
some meanings have been successfully understood by 'nonsensical' expressions also, while most nonsensical expressions suggest no meaning
that is to say, the law of identity and non contradiction are only for seeing expressions without meaning, or expressions that are trying to exploit in suggesting meanings

'the world having an understanding beyond it' is utter nonsense, this is obvious

so the world where it is understood as 'only Being' 'the one at all' 'Being at all' inherently does not have any understanding for 'when there is nothing' at all, as those understandings such a world can ever have are just 'non-beings' which are just 'beings in a not so positive way' which are still beings afterall, not what is meant with 'when there is nothing'
yet, the world itself has, for it has understandings such as 'when there is Being' and 'when there is nothing'
so when beings are presumptuous and put an 'at all' to any of them and treat it as canonical, it then can appeal to itself and rejects any understanding it likes, reframe it in its way, but the point is that if the world is actually to be understood as any of them, then those understandings are not even had to even be rejected
so 'only Being' and the sorts are not canonical

it is not to say that 'the understanding for when there is nothing' is the same as 'nought' (a better name to capture the sense of 'nothing')
such understanding are still well within the world, while such understanding tells that the world 'does not have anything to do at all' with nought, since, there is nothing at all
it is to be understood that the world is intransitively 'irrelevant', and so it does not have anything to do even with 'nothing at all', but this does not mean that it again just 'only ever world' (which mean it rejects nought), for 'what does this it even mean if the world is absolutely irrelevant while rejecting nought?' this does not make sense and it is nonsense in that 'rejecting nought' is nonsensical with 'irrelevant', hence 'at first' 'at default', nought (for 'at first' and 'at default' are just other names for 'nought')
for how can 'nothing at all' to be understood but as 'there is nothing at all to be understood'? and so even 'only Being' cannot itself rejects 'nought' without reframe it

in this pedagogy, there is only one state, that is 'the being of a thing' or not, this 'or not' is not another state, this 'or not' is not anything at all
you and i will both imagine two identical spheres
now we each will pick one sphere
our choice is indeed ineffable from each other
we restart
now we imagine one sphere
we will pick that
next, how about another sphere
so there is two sphere now
yet our choice is the same, we chose the 'first' sphere
what does this tells us?
for each case there are two identical sphere, yet in the second case we manage to have the same choice
this tells us that the 'when the thing' is ever more intimate than 'the thing itself', and works like but ever purer than 'this' in 'this thing' also

for being is 'the where it is'
but 'where there is nothing at all' suggest a ontological hole, or a negation
for 'how about nought'
is to meant 'when there is nothing at all'
the 'where' is more presumptuous than the 'when', the 'where' is the 'itself' and the 'this' when they are presumptuous

it is not a principle 'where' things at, since 'when there is nought and being' does not make sense (and if it were to be understood, it would just mean 'when there is being'), a 'when' that can be treated as a 'where' is simply a 'where' borrowing the name 'when', but the true sense of 'when' is much more than that of the 'where', it is the utmost intimate, inherent sense for 'a thing'

we restart
consider 'the' totality, any totality in any sense, the greatest it can ever be, 'how about the one', 'how about Being', the totality of not just the world but even of worlds, 'how about all of them', 'how about all of worlds', 'when there is all of worlds'
but then
'how about this new one?'
that is to say
'when there firstly is this new one at all'
it is simply new beyond the totality because it 'suddenly is'
this firstly itself
this now
when there is this, it is firstly itself
when there firstly is this new one at all

a when did not work like a where, it does not comes from any hidden principle, for if there is a hidden principle already for it then it is just happens where such a thing. a when is absolutely intransitively irrelevant, utterly unique, utterly new

this is the true name of time
since if you really look at Being as understood in the old sense, it is inherently static, they only add the axiom 'that it is lively' in
while with
when this
this now
this firstly itself
when there firstly is this at all
when this firstly itself
it simply is lively

we may try to save 'totality' one last time
'when there is all the when'
but then, this is now just a 'where'
the 'where' are those 'already when'
and so, we ask the totality
'how about this new one?'
what more, can be more magical than this?

and philosophy ends along, when there is no lack of worlds

put simply
there are worlds and each is 'already when', our world now is one of the newest of them (for worlds are exhaustively worlds hence each is already when, already there, hence there are those newest in worlds)
but 
'how about this new one'
that why the final understanding is 'when there is no lack of worlds'
not 'when there is all when' since
'how about this new one'

to ask that
how about 'when this' 'when' sooner
as in, all when 'when at once', is literally nonsense
for 'when this' is simply not 'when that', for 'when this' is its own time, more intimate than 'itself', it is nonsensical to ask 'how about it is not itself'

it is not that an 'already when' cease 'when' a new one, for each is irrelevant
singularly, a 'when' is just and exhaustively a 'when', so 'when it cease, after when it is' is plain nonsense (since 'when it' is already all there is for it)

there is a sense of 'timely' or 'orderly' but is not in any old sense not relevant at all, not a where at all, but it is because 'this new one' is 'intransitively newest' simply because it is 'firstly itself', that is the true sense of 'when'
